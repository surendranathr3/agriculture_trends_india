Analysis of crop data in India

Here are some of the questions I'd like to investigate with agriculture data:
1. What is the market-wise price variation in crops all over India?
2. How have the prices of certain commodities varied over the years?
3. What are the factors affecting the prices?
4. Impact of weather on crops and prices
